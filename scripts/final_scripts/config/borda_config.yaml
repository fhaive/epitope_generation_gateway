  # NA handling policy for each feature:
  # - ignore: rows with NA for a feature are excluded from that feature's ranking,
  #           and the feature's weight is redistributed per-row by renormalizing
  #           over the *available* features for that row (so no penalty).
  # - worst:  NA gets 0 points for that feature (penalizes missing values).
  # - drop:   drop rows that have NA in *any* selected feature (strict).
